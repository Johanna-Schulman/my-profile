			<h2>ESSEC BBA</h2>
			<p>I am currently a bachelor in businesss administration student at ESSEC Business School in Cergy, near Paris. I study various subjects, such as marketing, communication, entrepreneurship, economy, management, law and finance. I am particularly interested in Human Resources. Later, I would like a job where I could help those in need.</p>

			<h2>Travelling</h2>
			<p>I had the opportunity to travel a lot. Whether it was with my family or in summer camps. I'm very lucky to have had the chance to visit every continent except for Oceania. My favorite trip was a humanitarian exchange in Peru in 2018. There, I helped and asssisted young orphans by giving them school supplies, clothes and games. As I spent a month in the country I also had the time to get to know the various its cultures and fabulous places such as Machu Pichu, the Titicaca lake or the Incas' sacred valley.</p>

			<h2>Food</h2>
			<p>My mother being a professional pastry chef, she made me discover food and fall in love with the process of making it. I like to spend my free time cooking, trying out new recipes and I find it very relaxing. I especially enjoy cooking sweet rather than savoury food. My favourite cuisine is the Italian, since it is very generous, tasty and offers a wide range of possibilities. Cooking is to me the 8th art.</p>

			<h2>Friends and family</h2>
			<p>The most important thing in life is friends and family. I love hanging out at any possible time with my firends as much as I enjoy spending time at home with my family. They make me feel comfortable being myself. What I am particularly fond of is discovering new things, being adventurous, laughing and not getting too worked up. To make it short, living life at its fullest. </p>
